    "text": "✨ DataFest 2025 — Real Estate Micro-Trends Analysis\nMy first big project comes from a hackathon I participated in at UCLA. During this fast paced, caffeine fueled 48 hours, my team and I, named the Dangerous Ducklings, analyzed a large commercial real estate dataset provided by Savills. Our goal was to uncover micro-trends in U.S. office leasing and understand how demand has shifted in the post-pandemic landscape.\nWe focused primarily on Los Angeles County, where we cleaned and merged thousands of lease records, geocoded building addresses, and explored spatial patterns in A-class and O-class office buildings. Ultimately, we aimed to build a clear model and scoring system that helped our work stand out among the 70+ teams competing.\nRole: Team Member, Data Science Competitor\nTools: R, tidyverse, ggplot2, sqldf, spatial visualization, data cleaning\nOur project included:\n\nCleaning and merging high-volume leasing data\nGeocoding and mapping building-level spatial patterns\nExploratory data analysis with custom visualizations\nIdentifying meaningful micro-market trends across LA\nDelivering a concise, actionable final presentation\n\nThis experience strengthened my ability to work quickly, collaboratively, and creatively under constraints.\nFinal Presentation: View Slides"
