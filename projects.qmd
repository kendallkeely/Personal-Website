Welcome to my project portfolio! Here is a selection of work that reflects my interests in data science, statistical modeling, visualization, and real-world analytical problem solving.

## * DataFest 2025 — Commercial Real Estate Micro-Trends (UCLA)

During UCLA’s 48-hour DataFest competition, my team and I, named the Dangerous Ducklings, analyzed a large commercial real estate dataset provided by Savills. Our goal was to uncover micro-trends in U.S. office leasing and understand how demand has shifted in the post-pandemic landscape.

We focused primarily on Los Angeles County, where we cleaned and merged thousands of lease records, geocoded building addresses, and explored spatial patterns in A-class and O-class office buildings.

**Role:** Team Member, Data Science Competitor\
**Tools:** R, tidyverse, ggplot2, sqldf, spatial visualization, data cleaning

Our project included:

- Cleaning and merging high-volume leasing data
- Geocoding and mapping building-level spatial patterns
- Exploratory data analysis with custom visualizations
- Identifying meaningful micro-market trends across LA
- Delivering a concise, actionable final presentation

This experience strengthened my ability to work quickly, collaboratively, and creatively under constraints.

## * Storage Star Summer Internship — Capstone Project

**Role:** Data Science Intern\
**Tools:** R, tidyverse, modeling, visualization, reporting, Quarto

For my summer internship at Storage Star, I completed a data-driven capstone project analyzing **rent per square foot trends** across Texas, Colorado, Utah, and California markets. My final deliverable included a multi-part analytics report incorporating:

-   Quarter-over-quarter change detection\
-   Power model fitting and diagnostics\
-   Climate-controlled vs non-climate unit comparisons\
-   Outlier identification and sensitivity analyses\
-   Clean, reproducible visualizations using R

This project emphasized reproducible research, statistical modeling, and real-world business decision support.

## * Drone Strike Analysis — Stats 140XP

**Role:** Statistical Analyst\
**Tools:** R, nonparametric testing, visualization, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney

For our Stats 140XP final project, my group investigated whether U.S. political party control affects the **lethality, accuracy, and magnitude** of drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia.

Our work included:\

 - Building a cleaned annual dataset from The Guardian’s raw records\
- Creating derived metrics such as med_people_killed and accuracy ratios\
- Testing partisan differences using nonparametric methods\
- Visualizing lethality distributions and time trends\
- Presenting results in a written report and slide deck

Our findings showed significantly higher lethality under Democratic presidents, but no significant difference in accuracy.
