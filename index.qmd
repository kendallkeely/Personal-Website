# Hello, I'm Kendall!

I’m a fourth Statistics & Data Science major with a Mathematics minor at UCLA. I am originally from the Bay Area, where I grew up surrounded by tech, numbers, and a love for problem solving, all of which eventually led me to pursue data.

At UCLA, I split my time between classes, research projects, and campus involvement. Outside of academics, you can find me at the beach, exploring new restaurants, or playing tennis with friends.
